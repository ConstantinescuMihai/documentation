# Plant An App Documentation

## Getting started

In order to get started contributing to the documentation, you will need the following:
  * [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  * [GitExtensions](http://gitextensions.github.io/)

First of all, you will need GitExtensions and Visual Studio Code installed in order to have control over the repository and be able to modify the documentation.

Second, you have to follow the Docusaurus installation [guide](https://docusaurus.io/docs/en/installation) which will explains all the steps necessary in order to get a local version up and running. This will help you see how your changes look and be sure everything is correct. Everything about how Docusaurus works is laid on in the documentation of it, from the very basic page adding all the way up to localized pages and such.

After following the installation guide you should be able to open up a powershell command line in the `website`  directory and start the local server by running `npm-start`. This is the basic example site that docusaurus sets you up with in order to get up and running.

In order to get the Plant An App documentation locally, you will have to clone the repository in a different folder and the paste the contents of the said folder over the starting app, this should refresh the page and you should be able to see our documentation locally.
