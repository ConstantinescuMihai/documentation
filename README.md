# Plant An App Documentation

## Getting started

In order to get started contributing to the documentation, you will need the following:
  * [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  * [GitExtensions](http://gitextensions.github.io/)

First of all, you will need GitExtensions and Visual Studio Code installed in order to have control over the repository and be able to modify the documentation.

You will also have to install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install). The minimum versions currently requested by Docusaurus are Node >= 8.X and Yarn >= 1.5.

The quick set-up procedure is the following:  

  1. Clone the repository into your folder of choice. 
  2. Navigate over to the folder `website`.
  3. Use the key combo `Ctrl + Shift + Right-Click` in order to bring up menu and select  'Open Powershell Window here'
  4. Inside the new window run the command `npm-install` which will install all the necessary dependencies to run Docusaurus locally.
  5. After the command finishes, run the command `npm start` which will start your local server and open a new tab with the site in your browser.
